		<p>This is my smashed pea gnocchi. It's a stunner of a summer dish and dead simple. You can use fresh peas if you like, but frozen really are the best.<em>Taken from Mob.</em>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>160g Frozen Peas</li>
                <li>180g Asparagus</li>
                <li>25g Basil</li>
                <li>500g Gnocchi</li>
                <li>3 tbsp Crème Fraîche</li>
                <li>80g Parmesan</li>
                <li>2 tbsp Unsalted Butter</li>
                <li>Olive Oil</li>
                <li>1 Lemon</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
			<ol>
                <li>Add all but a handful of the frozen peas to a blender or pestle and mortar and pulse/smash until pulpy.</li>
                <li>Trim and slice the asparagus, and roughly chop the basil.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil, season with salt and blanch the gnocchi until they float to the top. Fish them out into a bowl and coat with a dash of oil.</li>
                <li>Grab yourself a mugful of the cooking water and save that for later.</li>
                <li>Blanch the asparagus and that extra handful of peas for 1 min, drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>Now, heat a large frying pan over a high heat. Add a shot of oil and let that get nice and hot.</li>
                <li>Add the gnocchi and cook until golden brown. Keep the gnocchi moving regularly.</li>
                <li>Add the butter and cook until brown and the gnocchi is glazed and nut brown.</li>
                <li>Add a splash of the cooking water, the smashed peas and the crème fraîche. Toss everything together to create a beautifully green sauce.</li>
                <li>Season with salt and black pepper. Add lemon zest, Parmesan, the blanched veg and chopped basil.</li>
                <li>Keep tossing everything together until glossy and gorgeous. Adjust the seasoning if you need to.</li>
                <li>Divide between warm plates, top with more Parmesan and black pepper and get stuck in.</li>
			</ol>
