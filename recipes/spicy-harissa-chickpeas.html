        </p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>2 Garlic Cloves </li>
                <li>500g Cherry Tomatoes</li>
                <li>400g Tinned Cherry Tomatoes</li>
                <li>1kg Cooked Chickpea</li>
                <li>1 Vegetable Stock Cube</li>
                <li>2 tbsp Harissa</li>
                <li>1 Lemon</li>
                <li>Olive Oil</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Peel and finely slice the garlic. Place a saucepan over a medium-high heat and add a tbsp of olive oil. Poke the cherry tomatoes with the tip of a knife, this will encourage them to pop!</li>
                <li>Add the sliced garlic and cherry tomatoes to the pan and stir for 1 min, they should start to burst. Add the harissa paste and the can of cherry tomatoes. Bubble on a medium heat for 15 - 20 mins.</li>
                <li>Throw in the whole tin of chickpeas along with their liquid. Add the stock cube and turn up the heat to high. Use a potato masher or fork to crush the mix a bit- this will help thicken the sauce a little.</li>
                <li>Add the juice of half the lemon. Season to taste and pile into tupperware to enjoy throughout the week.</li>
